## Installation

In order to run the project locally, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

`npm install`
 
Then the user would need to launch their mysql within the command line through `mysql -u [username] -p` to initialize mysql. Once mysql is running in the command line, run `source db/schema.sql` and `source db/seed.sql` in order to create the database and enter data into the associated tables.

<br />

## Usage

The application works within the command line to allow users to view the existing departments, roles and employees, as well as adding departments, roles and employees as needed. The application utilitizes inquirer in order to generate the prompts that the user will interact with.
